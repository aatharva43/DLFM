Running the simulations using the three-dimensional computational cell model

Steps to run the simulation for one representative cell (Fig 1B) are provided here. Running the simulations for all other cells follows the same procedure.

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following software installed and linked:

- Abaqus
- Visual Studio
- Intel Parallel Studio XE
(Instructions to find and download the compatible versions of Visual Studio and Intel Fortran and properly link Abaqus with Fortran can be found online.)

Instructions:

1. Download and extract the Fig 1 Simulations folder: After downloading the Fig 1 Simulations folder, extract its contents to a directory of your choice.

2. Open Windows command prompt: Open the Windows command prompt by either opening the Start menu and searching for "cmd" or pressing the Windows key + R, typing "cmd" or "cmd.exe" in the Run command box, and pressing Enter.

3. Navigate to the Fig 1 Simulation folder: Use the command prompt to navigate to the drive and the path where you extracted the Fig 1 Simulations folder. For example:

C:
cd path\to\the\Fig 1 Simulation\folder

4. Run Abaqus simulation: Execute the "CellFiberUMAT.inp" from the command prompt:

abaqus job=CellFiberUMAT user=CellMatrixModel_06202020

The "CellFiberUMAT" file is the input file for the simulation of a representative cell (Fig 1B). Please note that the file "CellMatrixModel_06202020.for" contains a user subroutine UMAT code, which is based on the theoretical model for defining cell material properties. Each section of the UMAT code is explained with annotations for clarity and ease of understanding.

5. Verify simulation completion: Check the last line in the "CellFiberUMAT.log" file to ensure the Abaqus job "CellFiberUMAT" is completed.

6. Open simulation results in Abaqus: Open the "CellFiberUMAT.odb" file generated by the simulation.

7. Adjust visualization settings to plot the stress fibers (actin fibers):
- From the Results Tree on the left, navigate to Output Databases > CellFiberUMAT.odb > Instances
- Right-click on the PART-CELL-1 and pick Replace
- From the Menu bar, navigate to Plot > Symbols > On Deformed shape
- Navigate to Results > Field Output > Primary Variable > S (Stress components at integration points > Max. Principal > OK
- Ensure the deformation scale factor is uniform and set to 1 (From Options > Common > Basic > Deformation Scale Factor).
- Enable the translucency to have the actin fibers plot within the cytoskeleton (From Options > Common > Other > Translucency)

8. Adjust visualization settings to plot the focal adhesion:
- From the Results Tree on the left, navigate to Output Databases > CellFiberUMAT.odb > Instances
- Right-click on the PART-ADHESIONPART-1 and pick Replace
- From the Menu bar, navigate to Plot > Contours > On Deformed shape
- Navigate to Results > Field Output > Primary Variable > S (Stress components at integration points > Max. Principal > OK

9. Adjust visualization settings to plot the fiber network deformation:
- From the Results Tree on the left, navigate to Output Databases > CellFiberUMAT.odb > Instances
- Right-click on the PART-NANOFIBERWIRE-1 and pick Replace
- From the Menu bar, navigate to Plot > Deformed shape

Files Included:

- CellFiberUMAT.inp: Abaqus input file for the representative cell.
- CellMatrixModel_06202020.for: User subroutine UMAT code based on the theoretical model to define cell material properties.
